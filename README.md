# MyTubeStudio

MyTubeStudio is a Windows-only .NET WinUI 3 application for downloading and organizing YouTube content. It uses the YoutubeExplode NuGet package to download videos directly from YouTube and provides a richer way to manage your own local video library.

## Features

- Download YouTube videos via the YoutubeExplode library.
- Embedded browser that loads the YouTube website directly inside the app.
- Create flexible, nested playlists using a folder-like structure (e.g., STEM → Physics → Mathematics → Computer Science).
- Support for playlists that can contain other playlists, enabling hierarchical collections.
- Organize downloaded videos into custom categories beyond YouTube’s native playlist limitations.
- Designed specifically for Windows, using WinUI 3 for a modern desktop experience.
- Planned publishing to the Microsoft Store for easy installation and updates.

## Motivation

Standard YouTube playlists are powerful but limited: they are flat lists and can only contain videos. MyTubeStudio aims to provide a desktop-first experience that lets you download videos for offline use and organize them in a way that matches how you actually learn or work—using nested folders, grouped topics, and reusable playlists.
